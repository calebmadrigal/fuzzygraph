# fuzzygraph

<https://fuzzygraph.com>. Graphs where equations are not only exactly true, but close to true. Instead of black lines on a white background, this creates beautiful gradients.

# Features

- Visualizes graphs as colorful gradients (with many colormaps available)
- FuzzyGraph is a [Single-File Web App](https://gods.art/articles/single_file_web_apps.html) - a single fully self-contained HTML file (with no external dependencies) which can downloaded and run offline
- No sign-ups or user tracking (no cookies, no analytics code, etc)
- Saves images with equation and graph configuration (including pan, zoom, color map, etc) embedded in the saved PNG file such that images exported fom FuzzyGraph can be opened (which loads the config from the PNG image metadata).
- Share links (which embeds the graph config in url parameters)

# Roadmap

- [x] Backward compatibility for images and share links
- [x] New rendering algorithm (v2.0.0)
- [x] Advanced mode
- [ ] More precise pan and zoom controls
- [ ] More transfer function controls
- [ ] Shader-based rendering (for speed)
- [ ] Animation
